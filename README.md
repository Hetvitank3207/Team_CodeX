"BloodLink - Connecting Donors & Patients"

Project Name: BloodLink
Team Members: Trusha Patel, Hetvi Taank, Akshara Pandya, Kairavi Padhariya, Hima Mehta
Hackathon: Talent Sprint
Date: 07/09/2025

Project Overview :

BloodLink is a web-based platform designed to connect blood donors with patients in urgent need within a specific geographic radius. Users can register as donors or request blood, and the system matches them based on blood type and location. This solution helps reduce response time during emergencies and fosters a community of lifesavers.

Features:-
* Donor Registration: Register as a blood donor, providing blood type, location, and radius.
* Patient Requests: Patients can request blood specifying type and location.
* Automatic Matching: Find donors within a specified radius using geolocation.
* Location Detection: Users can use "Locate Me" to auto-fill their current location.
* Distance Calculation: Haversine formula calculates the distance between donor and patient.
* Responsive UI: Built with TailwindCSS for a modern, mobile-friendly design.

Tech Stack: 

* Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQLite
* Backend: Client-side storage using localStorage
* Deployment: Can be hosted on GitHub Pages

How to Use:-

For Donors:

1. Click "Become a Donor" in the hero section or scroll to the donor form.
2. Enter blood type, location (or use "Locate Me"), and radius.
3. Submit the form to register. Your data is stored locally for matching.

For Patients:

1. Click "Request Blood" or scroll to the patient form.
2. Enter required blood type, location (or use "Locate Me"), and radius.
3. Submit the form to see matching donors within the specified radius.
4. Matched donors will display blood type, location, and distance.

Future Enhancements:-

* Backend Database: Replace localStorage with a proper database like Firebase, MongoDB, or MySQL.
* Real-Time Notifications: Notify donors instantly when a request is made nearby.
* Map Integration: Display donors on an interactive map for easier visualization.
* User Authentication: Secure login for donors and patients.
* Analytics Dashboard: Track donation trends and requests.
